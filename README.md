## Branching, committing, and requesting pull

- master : it should be latest-tested-released version.
- staging : staging version. Should NOT commit / push any change, it's only for deployment
- <project> : named version (typically major version) release. It should contain major release and tested
- <project>_dev : On-going development version of the 'project release' named version. It should be sync'ed with project's website or client release for developing / testing version
- <project>_yourname : You should create branch based on <project>_dev first, then push your update to this remote branch. Once you'are sure your change works fine, and need to test with update by other developer, you need to create pull request, then merge BY YOURSELVE. Of course, your portion of code might affect other engineer's code, try to send pull reuqest to the engineers you're concerned.
